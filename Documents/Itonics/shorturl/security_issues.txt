General security issues in this app:-
-It doesn't checks whether email exists or not,
-Password field here doesn't require any special pattern (like: atleas 8 characters, atleast 1 number, atleast one special characher, atleast one capital letter etc)
-Password are encoded but not encrypted. 
-Password are stored in localstorage, instead of session, so after loggin out, the login token are still valid until the expiration time (i.e 1hr) 

Suggestion to overcome this issues:-
-Email existance should be checked. We can send account activation like the the give email address. 
-Password field should obey special characters set. (i.e. atleas 8 characters, atleast 1 number, atleast one special characher, atleast one capital letter etc)
-Password are better be encrypted.
-I think storing jwt token in the session is more preferable.
